About GitHub
============

The Basics
----------

At its simplest, GitHub is a hosting service for Git repositories. Much like 
Dropbox or Google Drive, it gives you a space to remotely store your code and 
related files. This can be useful when working on projects that require, for 
example, some kind of server, whether for the purposes of running large, 
potentially time-consuming data analyses or for serving up public-facing content 
(like a website). For such projects, GitHub acts as a reference point with which 
you can add, or **push**, changes on one computer and bring them down, or 
**pull** them, onto another. The process would look something like the following, 
where pushing and pulling from a remote branch entails keeping a reference point 
for a project that you're developing locally:

With this diagram in mind, it's not much of a conceptual leap to imagine how two 
or more people could work from the same remote repository. Each would pull that 
repository onto their respective local computers, make a branch, implement their 
changes, and push those changes back to the remote source. That way, multiple 
parts of a project could be under development simultaneously, and any such 
changes made to that project would be trackable according to the logic of version 
control.

Simultaneously pushing and pulling on multiple computers would look something 
like the following:

Communicating with GitHub
-------------------------

So far, however, this whole process could be implemented with other version 
control software. What makes GitHub special is the fact that, more than being 
simply a place to store files, the service is above all a _communication channel_. 
Where GitHub extends the functionality of version control is not just where it 
offers various forms of cloud hosting; it is also where GitHub provides tools 
that let people talk about the code they're working on. It's a place where team 
members can propose and explain the changes they make, look at changes others 
have made, track and discuss any bugs that might come up, get feedback from 
others, and plan for any future changes the team intends to make.

Learning how to use GitHub, then, is as much about learning how to communicate 
effectively through the different facets of the service as it is about 
acquainting yourself with new technical skills (i.e., using your computer to 
track code remotely). In this workshop, we'll discuss both parts of using the 
service and do so with an eye toward how GitHub can facilitate team science.

A short summary of the different facets of communication GitHub provides 
includes:

* Documentation, often through README files
* Issue tracking for bug reporting and assigning tasks
* Pull requests for proposing and discussing changes
* Wikis, which may feature additional documentation, tutorials, etc.
* Project boards for long-term planning
* Various graph visualizations for project overview

Additionally, GitHub users can monitor and modify other teams' code using 
"Watch", "Star", and "Fork" functionalities. The service also provides teams 
with the ability to specify licensing information for their projects.
