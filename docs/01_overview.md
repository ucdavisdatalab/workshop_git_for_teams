Preliminaries
=============

This workshop covers the basics of using Git in tandem with GitHub. It is a
**hybrid workshop**. First, independently work through this online tutorial at
your own pace and **ensure that you have set up GitHub account.** Next, join us
for the live interactive session (details below), during which we will learn
how to use GitHub to sync local and remote repositories, manage code, and work
in parallel with teams. If you need help troubleshooting your installation,
drop-in to [DataLab's virtual office hours][] prior to the interactive session
to ensure that you will be able to follow along on your own machine.

The full workshop description can be found [here][].
