This workshop covers the basics of using [git][] in tandem with [GitHub][], an
online platform for software development. During this workshop we'll practice
setting up, sharing, and collaboratively working on a repository for a research
project. We'll explore different features for improving your workflows, whether
you're working by yourself or with others on a data-driven project using
GitHub.

<!--
It is a **hybrid workshop**. First, independently work through this online
tutorial at your own pace and **ensure that you have set up GitHub account.**
Next, join us for the live interactive session (details below), during which we
will learn how to use GitHub to sync local and remote repositories, manage
code, and work in parallel with teams.

**Familiarity with Command Line and Git version control software is required.**
Participants should be proficient in navigating their machine and executing
basic Git commands using a shell scripting program (Terminal, Bash, etc.).
Before attending this workshop, learners should be able to create, modify and
navigate to a directory, place a directory under version control, and make,
stage and commit changes using Command Line.

Need to brush up? Preparatory workshops include DataLabâ€™s [Introduction to
the Unix Command Line][datalab-cli] and [Introduction to Version
Control][datalab-git].
