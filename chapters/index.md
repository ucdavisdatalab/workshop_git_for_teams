GitHub is an online platform for software development using Git for version
control. During this hands-on workshop we'll practice setting up, sharing, and
collaboratively working on a repository for a research project. We'll explore
different features for improving your workflows, whether you're working by
yourself or with others on a data-driven project using GitHub.
