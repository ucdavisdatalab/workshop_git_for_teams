Merging Remote Branches
=======================

Clicking on the hyperlink will take you directly to the issue you created. From
here, we're at a crossroads. We could go ahead and implement our changes on the
main branch (more about that in a minute) and close out the issue. But there
are a lot of participants in the workshop, and all those branches will be a
headache to merge seamlessly into main. What we'll do, then, is implement our
changes on only _one other_ remote branch, leaving the main one alone for now.

A Quick Change of Plans
-----------------------

First, on the "branches" page, find another branch with which to merge your
own. You should select a branch made by another workshop participant.

```{figure} ../img/github_branches_page.png
---
alt: "All available branches on the sandbox repository."
---
```

When you've decided on a branch, go to your issue and, in a comment, explain
your change of plans. Tag the person whose branch you'll be merging with using
"@". Click the green "Comment" button.

```{figure} ../img/github_leave_a_comment.png
---
alt: "A comment stream below an open issue."
---
```

In a real-world project, you might also edit the title of your issue to reflect
your changes, but for now, you can leave it as is.

Tracking a Remote Branch
------------------------

Now it's time to make a copy of the remote branch on your local computer. You
can find the branch on the command line with `git branch -a` (it'll be in red
text). If you don't see extra branches listed when you enter this command, run
`git fetch` and try again.

There are a few ways to get the branch itself. Newer versions of Git use:

```sh
git switch REMOTE_BRANCH
```
```text
Branch 'REMOTE_BRANCH' set up to track remote branch 'REMOTE_BRANCH' from 'origin'.
Switched to a new branch 'REMOTE_BRANCH'
```

If you have an older version of Git on your computer, you'll need to use a
checkout:

```sh
git checkout REMOTE_BRANCH
```
```text
Branch 'REMOTE_BRANCH' set up to track remote branch 'REMOTE_BRANCH' from 'origin'.
Switched to a new branch 'REMOTE_BRANCH'
```

In either case, Git will pull down a local copy of a remote branch and begin
tracking it.

Now, if you open the `README.md` file, you'll find that your name has
disappeared and the other person's name is there instead. With that, you should
now have _three_ branches on your local machine: the main branch, the one you
created, and the branch you've just fetched from GitHub.

Merging Branches
----------------

From here, we can merge branches as we normally would. Switch to your own
branch:

```sh
git checkout FIRST_NAME_LAST_INITIAL
```
```text
Switched to branch 'FIRST_NAME_LAST_INITIAL'
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/FIRST_NAME_LAST_INITIAL'.
```

Now, try merge the other branch into your own. You should see an error.

```sh
git merge OTHER_BRANCH
```
```text
Auto-merging README.md
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in README.md
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
```

This is because both you and the other person have put your names on the same
line. If you open `README.md` with Vim, or simply `cat` to screen, you'll see
where the problem is:

```sh
cat README.md
```
```text
Practice Repository: Reproducible Research for Teams with GitHub
================================================================

Workshop reader: https://ucdavisdatalab.github.io/workshop_git_for_teams/

Instructions:
-------------

Clone this repository, make a new branch named with your first name and last
initial (e.g. `FIRST_NAME_LAST_INITIAL`) and write your name below.

<<<<<<< HEAD
Name: <your name>

=======
Name: <other person's name>
>>>>>>> <other-branch>
```

Fix this conflict by deleting the conflict markers (everything between the
`<<<<<<<` and `>>>>>>>` marks) and the other person's changes. Add their name
after your own. The file should now look like this:

```sh
cat README.md
```
```text
Practice Repository: Reproducible Research for Teams with GitHub
================================================================

Workshop reader: https://ucdavisdatalab.github.io/workshop_git_for_teams/

Instructions:
-------------

Clone this repository, make a new branch named with your first name and last
initial (e.g. `FIRST_NAME_LAST_INITIAL`) and write your name below.

Name: <your name>, <other person's name>
```

Save and quit Vim. Then, add `README.md` to your staging area and commit your
changes. Your command line should look something like this when you're done:

```sh
git add README.md
git commit -m "resolve conflicts with <other person's> branch"
```
```text
[<FIRST_NAME_LAST_INITIAL> 1d00b8f] resolve conflicts with <other person's> branch
```

If you type `git status`, you'll see that your local repository is now ahead of
the remote one.

```sh
git status
```
```text
On branch FIRST_NAME_LAST_INITIAL
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/<first-name_last-initial>' by 1 commit.
  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

Go ahead and `push` your changes. If you go back to GitHub, you should now see
the modified README file rendered to the page.

```{figure} ../img/github_resolved_changes_rendered.png
---
alt: "A README.md file showing the new changes on GitHub."
---
```

Closing an Issue
----------------

Your task is done, so you can close your issue. Return to the "Issues" tab,
find your issue, and close it. If you'd like, you can leave a comment when you
close. Afterwards, the issue should look like this:

```{figure} ../img/closed_issue.png
---
alt: "A closed issue on GitHub."
---
```
