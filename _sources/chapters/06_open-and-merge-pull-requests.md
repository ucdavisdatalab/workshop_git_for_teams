Open and Merge a Pull Request
=============================

This last part of the workshop will be demo-only. Now that some changes have
been made to various branches, we're going to merge one of those branches back
into the main branch using a **pull request** (the instructor will demo this so
that we don't run into several conflicts). While we could simply merge a branch
back into main, a pull request provides a formalized workflow for letting
others know that we're proposing a change. In other words, a pull request is a
review process, in which team members can review and discuss changes, make
suggestions about how to improve changes or keep changes from breaking other
parts of a project, and finally implement changes into a project's base
repository.

We won't go over this much in the workshop itself, but note that many projects
let members of the public open pull requests and contribute changes. If, for
example, you notice a bug in R's `ggplot2` library and know how to fix it, you
could **fork** the repository into your own GitHub account, make the necessary
changes, and then open a pull request for the developers to review. If they
accept your changes, your code will be incorporated into the project.

Opening a Pull Request
----------------------

You can open a pull request by clicking on the "Pull requests" tab.

```{figure} ../img/github_pull_requests.png
---
alt: "The sandbox repository on GitHub with the pull requests tab activated."
---
```

From here, click on the green "New pull request."

Under the "Comparing changes" heading, select two branches from the drop down
menus. The branch on the right will be the branch you're merging _into_ the
branch on the left (i.e., the branch on the right is probably the one you've
been working on). Once you've made your selection, GitHub will scan through the
branches and identify any differences between them.

```{figure} ../img/github_compare_changes.png
---
alt: "Pull request comparison on GitHub, which shows the listing of the commits
made to each branch and a side-by-side view of the differences between the
branches."
---
```

If the branches are able to be merged, click "Create pull request." You'll be
taken to a new page, which looks quite similar to the what you'd see if you
opened an issue. Just like an issue, a pull request should have a title and a
description. You can assign yourself the role of making the request and, if
applicable, you can ask someone to review the changes before you implement them
(using the "Reviewers" function on the right).

```{figure} ../img/github_write_a_pull_request.png
---
alt: "Entering information into the pull request template, which includes a
title and comment."
---
```

Opening a pull request does not automatically implement a merge. Rather, the
pull request stays open, providing a space for people to discuss the changes,
make revisions if need be, etc.

Merging a Pull Request
----------------------

Once your team is happy with the changes, and once GitHub has verified that
there are no conflicts between the branches, you can click "Merge pull
request". Alternatively, you can merge the pull request on the command line by
following the instructions listed below.

```{figure} ../img/github_no_conflicts.png
---
alt: "A pull request on GitHub that is ready to be merged."
---
```

For our purposes, we'll just click the button. GitHub will then register that
the merge has been made:

```{figure} ../img/github_successful_pull_merge.png
---
alt: "A merged pull request on GitHub, showing each of its commits and a
message saying the pull request was successful."
---
```

If you went back to the main page, you'd see that your changes are implemented.
From here, you can delete your branch (if you'd like) and then start on the
next changes you'd like to make.
